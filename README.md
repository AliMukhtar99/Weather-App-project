# Weather-App-project

For my end of phase one project I've chosen to do a simple weather app using html,css and JavaScript.The app informs a person of the weather conditions in any given place with the help of a public API I found on a github page and if the location entered is not recognized it will return an error telling you to enter a correct city name.The project showcases things I've learned for the past four weeks like writing clean and readable code,fetching data from API's and adding event listeners.
