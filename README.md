# Weather-App-project

My project required me to build a weather app that worked with an API of my choice to deliver the weather of an area based on the individual’s typed location. This was one of my first introductions to working with an API so I knew there was going to be a steep learning curve but I was excited at the chance to finally get some practical application of Javascript and to build a functioning product.

After doing a little research and seeing some feedback from my technical mentor and fellow students I decided to use the OpenWeatherMap API. Setting up an account was as easy as it could be.

Once I had that set up I was ready to get coding. I started out by building out my HTML. I didn’t get overly fancy with the architecture since the emphasis of the build would be on JS. open HTML file and see what it looks like
After the HTML was in place I took some time to give it a little styling. Open css file to see what it entails.

And now, ladies and gentlemen for the part you've been waiting for;

                                                               JS!!

I started off my JS by creating empty variables of the information I would want to call and manipulate later on. Once I had my global variables set, I wrote a function to get the input of location by the user. I was able to do that by adding an event listener to the code. In the code, I am retrieving the value (location) the user typed in the input field and then fetching the weather data from the API. I was able to test that this API was working by using strings and numbers since I hadn’t fully set up the API.

After all this, the last and the main part remained which was displaying the fetched weather on the screen but before that, I also had to convert the fetched temperature to a proper scale. I chose Celsius in my case.

I also had to write a function that would showcase the date, month, and year alongside the weather display. Open css file to see what it contains;

And we are finally done!! Go on, open it in the browser and see what it looks like

That’s it! We now have a functioning weather app built with javascript! I learned a lot in this project. Most notably, how to work with APIs; to an extent. I know each API works differently than others but finally being exposed to one...I hope you enjoyed the read if you got this far.
